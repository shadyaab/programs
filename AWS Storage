Amazon S3
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance
Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. 
A bucket is a container for objects.
You can use bucket policies, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, access control lists (ACLs), and S3 Access Points to manage access.

Feature:
---------
  Buckets
    - A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. You can store any number of objects in a bucket and can have up to 100 buckets in your account. 

  Objects
    - Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3.
    - Objects consist of object data and metadata. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object.

  Key
    - An object key (or key name) is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket

  Versioning
    - You can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.

  Bucket policy
    - A bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that you can use to grant access permissions to your bucket and the objects in it.
    - Only the bucket owner can associate a policy with a bucket.
    - The permissions attached to the bucket apply to all of the objects in the bucket that are owned by the bucket owner.

  S3 Access Points
    - Amazon S3 Access Points are named network endpoints with dedicated access policies that describe how data can be accessed using that endpoint.
    - Access Points are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as GetObject and PutObject
    - Each access point has its own access point policy. You can configure Block Public Access settings for each access point.

  Access control lists (ACLs)
    - You can use ACLs to grant read and write permissions to authorized users for individual buckets and objects.
    - The ACL defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access.
    - ACLs are an access control mechanism that predates IAM
    - When ACLs are disabled, the bucket owner owns all the objects in the bucket and manages access to them exclusively by using access-management policies.

Amazon S3 storage classes
-------------------------
  S3 Standard:
    - the default storage class. If you don't specify the storage class when you upload an object, Amazon S3 assigns the S3 Standard storage class.
    
  S3 Standard-IA
    - Amazon S3 stores the object data redundantly across multiple geographically separated Availability Zones 
    - designed for long-lived and infrequently accessed data.
    - Suitable for infrequently accessed data
  
  S3 Intelligent-Tiering
    - S3 Intelligent-Tiering is an Amazon S3 storage class that's designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective 
      access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the only cloud storage class that delivers automatic cost 
      savings by moving data on a granular object level between access tiers
    - S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically stores objects in three access tiers:
      - Frequent Access: Objects that are uploaded or transitioned to S3 Intelligent-Tiering are automatically stored in the Frequent Access tier.
      - Infrequent Access: moves objects that have not been accessed in 30 consecutive days to the Infrequent Access tier.
      - Archive Instant Access: Moves any existing objects that have not been accessed for 90 consecutive days moved to the Archive Instant Access tier.
    - In addition to these three tiers, S3 Intelligent-Tiering offers two optional archive access tiers:
      - Archive Access: 90 days
      - Deep Archive Access: 180 days
      
  S3 One Zone-IA  
    - Amazon S3 stores the object data in only one Availability Zone
    - designed for long-lived and infrequently accessed data.
  
  S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
    - Use for archiving data that is rarely accessed and requires milliseconds retrieval
    - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval has higher data access costs than S3 Standard-IA Since its for archiving
  
  S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
    - Use for archives where portions of the data might need to be retrieved in minutes.
    - minimum storage duration period of 90 days and can be accessed in as little as 1-5 minutes by using an expedited retrieval.
  
  S3 Glacier Deep Archive
    - Use for archiving data that rarely needs to be accessed. 
    - Data stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class has a minimum storage duration period of 180 days and a default retrieval time of 12 hours. 
    
S3 Lifecycle Management
-------------------------
Manage your objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle
Actions: 
  Transition actions:
    - These actions define when objects transition to another storage class.
    - For example, you might choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after creating them
    
  Expiration actions
    - These actions define when objects expire
    - Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.
   
Unsupported lifecycle transitions
---------------------------------
  - Any storage class to the S3 Standard storage class.
  - Any storage class to the Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) class.
  - The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class to the S3 Standard-IA storage class.
  - The S3 One Zone-IA storage class to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, or S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage classes.
  

Amazon EBS (Amazon Elastic Block Store)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted block devices. 
You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances. EBS volumes that are attached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently 
from the life of the instance. You can create a file system on top of these volumes, or use them in any way you would use a block device (such as a hard drive). 
You can dynamically change the configuration of a volume attached to an instance.

We recommend Amazon EBS for data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence. EBS volumes are particularly well-suited for use as the 
primary storage for file systems, databases, or for any applications that require fine granular updates and access to raw, unformatted, block-level storage. A
mazon EBS is well suited to both database-style applications that rely on random reads and writes, and to throughput-intensive applications that perform long, 
continuous reads and writes.

Features of Amazon EBS
-----------------------
  - You create an EBS volume in a specific Availability Zone, and then attach it to an instance in that same Availability Zone. To make a volume available 
    outside of the Availability Zone, you can create a snapshot and restore that snapshot to a new volume anywhere in that Region.
  - You can copy snapshots to other Regions and then restore them to new volumes there, making it easier to leverage multiple AWS Regions for geographical 
    expansion, data center migration, and disaster recovery.
  - Amazon EBS provides the following volume types: General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, Throughput Optimized HDD, and Cold HDD.
  - You can create your EBS volumes as encrypted volumes, in order to meet a wide range of data-at-rest encryption 
  - hen you create an encrypted EBS volume and attach it to a supported instance type, data stored at rest on the volume, disk I/O, and snapshots created 
    from the volume are all encrypted. 
  - You can create point-in-time snapshots of EBS volumes, which are persisted to Amazon S3. Snapshots protect data for long-term durability, and they can be used as 
    the starting point for new EBS volumes
  - Performance metrics, such as bandwidth, throughput, latency, and average queue length, are available through the AWS Management Console
