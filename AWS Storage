Amazon S3
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance
Amazon S3 is an object storage service that stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any metadata that describes the file. 
A bucket is a container for objects.
You can use bucket policies, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, access control lists (ACLs), and S3 Access Points to manage access.

Feature:
---------
  Buckets
    - A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. You can store any number of objects in a bucket and can have up to 100 buckets in your account. 

  Objects
    - Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3.
    - Objects consist of object data and metadata. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object.

  Key
    - An object key (or key name) is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket

  Versioning
    - You can use S3 Versioning to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.

  Bucket policy
    - A bucket policy is a resource-based AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy that you can use to grant access permissions to your bucket and the objects in it.
    - Only the bucket owner can associate a policy with a bucket.
    - The permissions attached to the bucket apply to all of the objects in the bucket that are owned by the bucket owner.

  S3 Access Points
    - Amazon S3 Access Points are named network endpoints with dedicated access policies that describe how data can be accessed using that endpoint.
    - Access Points are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as GetObject and PutObject
    - Each access point has its own access point policy. You can configure Block Public Access settings for each access point.

  Access control lists (ACLs)
    - You can use ACLs to grant read and write permissions to authorized users for individual buckets and objects.
    - The ACL defines which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access.
    - ACLs are an access control mechanism that predates IAM
    - When ACLs are disabled, the bucket owner owns all the objects in the bucket and manages access to them exclusively by using access-management policies.

Amazon S3 storage classes
-------------------------
  S3 Standard:
    - the default storage class. If you don't specify the storage class when you upload an object, Amazon S3 assigns the S3 Standard storage class.
    
  S3 Standard-IA
    - Amazon S3 stores the object data redundantly across multiple geographically separated Availability Zones 
    - designed for long-lived and infrequently accessed data.
    - Suitable for infrequently accessed data
  
  S3 Intelligent-Tiering
    - S3 Intelligent-Tiering is an Amazon S3 storage class that's designed to optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective 
      access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the only cloud storage class that delivers automatic cost 
      savings by moving data on a granular object level between access tiers
    - S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically stores objects in three access tiers:
      - Frequent Access: Objects that are uploaded or transitioned to S3 Intelligent-Tiering are automatically stored in the Frequent Access tier.
      - Infrequent Access: moves objects that have not been accessed in 30 consecutive days to the Infrequent Access tier.
      - Archive Instant Access: Moves any existing objects that have not been accessed for 90 consecutive days moved to the Archive Instant Access tier.
    - In addition to these three tiers, S3 Intelligent-Tiering offers two optional archive access tiers:
      - Archive Access: 90 days
      - Deep Archive Access: 180 days
      
  S3 One Zone-IA  
    - Amazon S3 stores the object data in only one Availability Zone
    - designed for long-lived and infrequently accessed data.
  
  S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
    - Use for archiving data that is rarely accessed and requires milliseconds retrieval
    - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval has higher data access costs than S3 Standard-IA Since its for archiving
  
  S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
    - Use for archives where portions of the data might need to be retrieved in minutes.
    - minimum storage duration period of 90 days and can be accessed in as little as 1-5 minutes by using an expedited retrieval.
  
  S3 Glacier Deep Archive
    - Use for archiving data that rarely needs to be accessed. 
    - Data stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class has a minimum storage duration period of 180 days and a default retrieval time of 12 hours. 
    
S3 Lifecycle Management
-------------------------
Manage your objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle
Actions: 
  Transition actions:
    - These actions define when objects transition to another storage class.
    - For example, you might choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after creating them
    
  Expiration actions
    - These actions define when objects expire
    - Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.
   
Unsupported lifecycle transitions
---------------------------------
  - Any storage class to the S3 Standard storage class.
  - Any storage class to the Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) class.
  - The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class to the S3 Standard-IA storage class.
  - The S3 One Zone-IA storage class to the S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Standard-IA, or S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval storage classes.
